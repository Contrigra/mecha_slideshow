## Mecha Slideshow

A small slideshow of some cool mecha

GitHub pages: https://contrigra.github.io/mecha_slideshow/

The goal was to practice JavaScript, logic and try to implement something so commonly occurring on the web.

### Things I practiced and learnt:

- Classes. Haven't really tried to use
- Centering divs :p
- How to select using data-attribute `.dot[data-index="${newIndex}"]`
- Modules are deferred by default
- Opacity using `rgba`
- `background-size`
- e.classList.toggle
- Building a slideshow, which is a very common task on the web
